                    A fresh sample must be collected for barcoding to work correctly. Insects must be collected and stored in 100% ethanol immediately after. Samples should be stored in the freezer to further protect from degradation.

                    Purpose: isolate DNA molecules from cells or tissues for various scientific or research purposes. Reagents/supplies in order and their purpose:
                    <ul class = "li2">
                    <li>ATL Buffer: Lyse (break open) cells and tissues to release the DNA contained within them. It does this by disrupting the cell membranes and nuclear membranes, effectively releasing the cellular and nuclear contents, including DNA, into the solution. </li>
                    <li>Proteinase K: Proteinase K is highly effective at digesting a wide range of proteins, including nucleases and other enzymes that could potentially degrade the extracted DNA. By breaking down these proteins, proteinase K helps protect the integrity of the DNA during the extraction process.</li>
                    <li>Buffer AL: Designed to lyse (break open) cells and tissues to release the DNA contained within them. It works in combination with other reagents in the kit to disrupt cell membranes and nuclear membranes, effectively releasing the cellular and nuclear contents, including DNA, into the solution.</li>
                    <li>Ethanol: Added because nucleic acid pellets are not soluble in ethanol and will not dissolve during washing. This helps to keep the DNA together and out of solution with the unwanted components.</li>
                    <li>Buffer AW1: Serves the purpose of facilitating the initial washing steps after DNA binding to the silica membrane in the spin column. These washing steps are crucial for removing impurities, contaminants, and residual chemicals from the DNA extraction process. Buffer AW1 is a specially formulated wash buffer that helps achieve effective purification and isolation of high-quality DNA. </li>
                    <li>Buffer AW2: Similar to AW1, AW2 is a formulated wash buffer that is used to further purify the DNA by removing residual contaminants, salts, and impurities from the DNA extraction process.</li>
                    <li>AE Buffer: Elute (release) the purified DNA from a solid support, such as a spin column or a silica membrane, where it was bound during the DNA extraction or purification process. Elution is the final step of the DNA extraction protocol and is crucial for obtaining the DNA in a usable form for downstream applications.</li>
